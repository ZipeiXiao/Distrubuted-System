Diffie-Hellman-Merkle Key Exchange 

95-702 Lab 5 

In this lab, you will modify existing UDP-based client and socket programs to
implement the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.

1. Download UDPServer.java and UDPClient.java. Create an IntelliJ project with a
package named cmu.edu.ds; copy the two classes into this package.

Compile and run the server code first. If an exception is thrown, change the
port number and try again (and use that port number in the client). Then compile
and run the client code; enter an integer, then verify that the client
receives back the integer+1.

:checkered_flag:**This is the checkpoint for this lab. Show your TA that you have the client and server
running.**

2. Read the following article about the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange

3. Implement the algorithm by changing the client and server code. The client
will be Alice and the server will be Bob. As described in the article on the Diffie-
Hellman Key exchange, Alice and Bob will begin with a modulus p = 23 and a base g = 5.
Have ALice choose a secret random integer a between 2 and 22. Have Bob choose a
secret random integer b between 2 and 22.

Have Alice transmit g^a mod p to Bob. As a response to the transmission from Alice, Bob
replies with g^b mod p.

Both Alice and Bob compute s (the shared secret.)

On Alice's console, display the secret integer that she now shares with Bob (s). On Bob's
console, display the secret integer that he shares with Alice (s).

4. The modulus p above is too small. Change your modulus p to the following integer.
This integer is very probably prime. It is about 2,048 bits in size. Use Java's
BigInteger class.

The values for a and b are also too small. Use the following Java method to create
random values for a and b that are 2,046 bits in length.

public BigInteger(int numBits, Random rnd)

We can leave the value of g at 5.

:checkered_flag:**Show your TA that Alice and Bob are able to arrive at a shared secret using these very
large BigIntegers.**
