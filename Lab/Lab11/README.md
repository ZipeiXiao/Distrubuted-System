# Lab 11 - Commodity Trading Simulation

For this lab, you need to demonstrate that you have the [Project 6](https://github.com/CMU-Heinz-95702/Project6) trading
simulation working.

Carefully follow the instructions for Project 6 until the :checkered_flag:.

When you have the simulation working to 20000 trades, show a TA to
get full credit for the lab. (And you are ready to start the project.)
